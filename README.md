> **AI-powered customer intelligence for banking** — cluster customers by behavior and forecast regional transaction revenue using K-Means and Linear Regression.

## Business Problem Statement

Modern banks serve millions of customers with highly varied financial behaviors. A one-size-fits-all approach leads to:
- Revenue leakage from mismatched products
- High churn in under-served segments
- Inefficient capital allocation across regions

This project solves two critical business problems:
1. **Who are our customers?** — Identify distinct behavioral clusters using K-Means
2. **Where is revenue growing?** — Forecast regional transaction volume using Linear Regression

## Economic Concepts Applied

| Concept | Application |
|---------|------------|
| **Price Discrimination** | Tailor fees & interest rates per customer segment |
| **Demand-Supply Analysis** | Match banking service supply to forecasted regional demand |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | Prioritize retention of high-CLV Premium Savers |
| **Risk Analysis (Credit Risk)** | Use cluster credit profiles to adjust lending terms |
| **Revenue Optimization** | Direct marketing spend to high-growth West & South regions |
| **Market Segmentation** | Segment-specific product design aligned to customer needs |

---

## AI Techniques Used

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **K-Means Clustering** | Unsupervised customer segmentation (K=4 clusters) |
| **Elbow Method + Silhouette Score** | Optimal cluster count selection |
| **PCA (2D)** | Dimensionality reduction for cluster visualization |
| **Linear Regression** | Regional transaction volume forecasting |
| **Feature Engineering** | BalanceToIncome, LoanToBalance, AvgTransactionAmt ratios |
| **StandardScaler** | Feature normalization for both models |

## Customer Segments Discovered

| Segment | Profile | Strategy |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Premium Savers | High balance, high credit, long tenure | Wealth management, VIP retention |
| Growth Investors | Mid-life, asset growth, multi-product | Investment products, mortgages |
| Active Spenders | High frequency, credit cards, young | Cashback rewards, credit limits |
| Entry-Level | Low balance, new customers, digital-native | Digital onboarding, savings education |

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Dataset Size | 1M rows (Kaggle) |
| K-Means K | 4 clusters |
| Silhouette Score | ~0.25 |
| Linear Regression R² | ~0.85+ |
| Highest Growth Region | West (+20%), South (+15%) |
| Best Revenue Cluster | Premium Savers |
